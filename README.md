# NCNews

With this project I'm intending to make a [reddit](https://reddit.com/) clone for learning purposes.
To access this project hosted by heroku click on the following link:

* [NCNews](https://glacial-brushlands-79472.herokuapp.com/api)

If youâ€™d prefer to run locally you can follow the instructions below.

## Getting Started

1. In order to run this code you need to install nodeJS. To check if you have nodeJS installed open you terminal window and run/paste the following command:

```
node -v
```

If it is installed, it will show you the version of node you have installed. e.g.:
`v8.4.0.`
If you do not have nodeJS installed, follow the installation instructions found [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/).

2. Make sure you have `npm` installed. Open a terminal window and run the following command:

```
npm -v
```

If it's installed, it will show you the version of npm you have installed. e.g.: `5.5.1.`
If you do not have npm installed, then run/paste the following command:

```
npm install npm
```

3. Make sure you have MongoDB installed in your computer, to check if you have MongoDB run the following command in your console:

```
mongod -version
```

If it's installed it will show you what version is installed, e.g: `db version v3.4.10`.
If is not installed you can follow these links for the instalation:

* [Install MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/)
* [MongoDB Windows](https://docs.mongodb.com/tutorials/install-mongodb-on-windows/#install-mongodb-community-edition)

## Installation

Please follow the instructions to clone this project and install all the necessary dependencies.

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the folder in which you wish to save the project. Run the following command:

git clone https://github.com/Dpartipilo/NCNews.git
```

2. Navigate into the new created folder `e.g: NCNews` and run the following command:

```

3. Is usually a good idea to run the database in a separate console window/tab, now on your new console run the following command:

```
mongod
```

Wait a couple of seconds until is ready to accept requests.

4. Once `mongod` is successfully running you are ready to run the tests. To run the tests use the following command:

```
npm test
```
